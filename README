LTTng inter-version compatibility test suite.
============================================

This project aim to provide an inter-version compatibility test suite to
document, automate, validate behaviours of the LTTng projects between version
and prevent unexpected regression. 

This project is intended to run inside a Continuous Integration environment.
A running version will be made available on ci.lttng.org.

A python3 virtual env is recommenced to run this test suite.

The suite is currently run under a python 3.5.3 virtual environment situated at
the root of the current directly under .venv.

The virtualenv can be configured with the provided requirement.txt

The running environment should provide all dependencies required by
lttng-ust/lttng-tools/lttng-modules 2.7/2.8/2.9/2.10, babeltrace 1.3/1.4/1.5.

Latest liburcu stable is also recommended.

How to run:
==========

1: python lttng_ivc/bootstrap.py
2: python lttng_ivc/build_projects.py
3: pytest -sv lttng_ivc/tests/

With tox:

1: tox -r ./

Findings
========

The binding type (ld.so) (now or lazy) is dependent on the gcc/ld distribution
configuration. Hence, for this test suite, we force the behavior to "now". This
result in the lookup of all required symbols at launch. This is particularly
important since we want to prevent inconsistent behavior. Immediate might be
forced in the future for lttng project but for now we simply force it at
runtime.
